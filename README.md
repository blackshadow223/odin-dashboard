# odin-dashboard

This is the 2nd project from the course *Intermediate HTML and CSS Course* from the curriculum [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

The lessons for this project revolved around CSS Grid, and one of the requirements for this project is to use CSS Grid (along with Flexbox) as much as possible.

I have done my best.
